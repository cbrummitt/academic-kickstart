  I serve as a scientist embedded on the Systems Innovation team, where I help incubate new technologies across Indigo's horizontal business. These projects range from finding better strategies for growing crops to monitoring grain in the supply chain after harvest to creating a carbon credit market for agriculture. Working closely with data science, engineering, and product teams, I
 
  * develop recommendations to agronomists and farmers (e.g., how much fertilizer to apply and when) using statistical machine learning, field experiments, and agronomic knowledge
  * plan experiments in tens of thousands of acres each year
  * visualize data for agronomists and growers using Python's ecosystem (plot.ly, pandas, geopandas)
  * calibrate grain quality sensors and statistically assess their performance
  * strategize how to make agriculture more data-driven, scientific, profitable, and sustainable
